# MIPS-16-Pipeline
This repository features a pipelined 16-bit MIPS processor in VHDL, supporting arithmetic, logical, memory, and control instructions. Designed for educational use, it demonstrates MIPS architecture with enhanced performance through pipelining. Includes test benches for hands-on experimentation.
